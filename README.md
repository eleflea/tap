# GPT Data Tagger & Analyzer

## üìò Overview

The **GPT Data Tagger & Analyzer** is a cloud-native system that leverages the ChatGPT API to analyze and tag cybersecurity threat data sourced from open intelligence feeds. Designed for both **scheduled and real-time queries**, it uses structured prompts to extract actionable insights such as:

- Attack vectors  
- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)  
- Other key indicators of compromise (IOCs)

Deployed on **AWS**, the platform provides timely, precise responses to cybersecurity questions‚Äîsuch as the **ransomware attack lifecycle** or threat-specific TTPs to enhance threat detection, investigation, and response.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. **Update AWS Account**
   - In `bin/tap.ts`, update your AWS account number on **line 17**.

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**
   - Create access keys via IAM.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```

4. **Setup Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:
     - `API_KEY`
     - GitHub credentials
     - Any other required secrets

5. **Install dependencies**

## üöÄ Running the API

To test the system:

1. Go to the **API Gateway** console in AWS.
2. Locate and copy the endpoint URL (make sure it ends in `/websites`).
3. Replace the placeholder URL in `apis/index.txt` with the actual API URL.
4. Use **Postman** or terminal to test the endpoints:
   - `PUT` and `DELETE` requests require an `id` parameter in the URL (as outlined in `apis/index.txt`).
