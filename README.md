# GPT Data Tagger & Analyzer

## üìò Overview

The **GPT Data Tagger & Analyzer** is a cloud-native system that leverages the ChatGPT API to analyze and tag cybersecurity threat data sourced from open intelligence feeds. Designed for both **scheduled and real-time queries**, it uses structured prompts to extract actionable insights such as:

- Attack vectors  
- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)  
- Other key indicators of compromise (IOCs)

Deployed on **AWS**, the platform provides timely, precise responses to cybersecurity questions‚Äîsuch as the **ransomware attack lifecycle** or threat-specific TTPs to enhance threat detection, investigation, and response.
